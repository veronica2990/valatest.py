# valatest.py
 main.py :
 This code will generate valid pair of numbers and then loop through each of the math functions.storing the results in 'dummy_list' and for each value in 'dummy_list' it will check the corresponding value of 'B' would be valid or not.It prints the result if it is and then calls 'math_problem()'to generate a new problem and repeat the process.

Test 1.py :
This code will valid pair of numbers and then loop through theeach math_person and then stores the list of values in the 'empty.dictionart'.For each value it will check the 'empty dictionary' and stores the value in the 'empty_list().append'.after that it will generate the random values for A and B and runs the formula .It prints the result if it matches the math person and and analyses the jury wa correct or not and repeat the process.

Test 2 and Test 3:
This code will use the class person and initiates the 4 persons and uses the sub classes with teh randon values given by jury for A and B.
Here i have used the Inheritance and polymorphism for intiating the personsa nd the random values.After generating the randon values it choose a math person to run the formula and guesses B and the math person.It prints the result if the guess was correct and calls the 'math_person' to generate a new value and repeat the process.
